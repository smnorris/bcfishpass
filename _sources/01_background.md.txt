# Background

The multi-agency Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG) was formed in 2007 when the Province of British Columbia, the Government of Canada, and several provincial forest industry associations identified the need to address the issue of road stream crossings fragmenting freshwater fish habitat throughout BC.  Roads and railways built prior to the mid 20th century did not prioritize fish passage, and the original crossing structures are often still in place. Even those crossings designed and installed with fish passage in mind can become degraded over time, leading to perched outlets, culverts collapsing or infilling with debris, and other issues that can impede passage of fish. The FPTWG has partnered with stakeholders, NGOs and industry to assess crossings and restore fish habitat connectivity.

With over 500,000 mapped locations of road/rail stream crossings acting as potential barriers, a system for site prioritization is required. `bcfishpass` attempts to provide users a common reference point by modelling and/or tracking:

- natural barriers to fish passage (waterfalls, subsurface flow, steep gradients, other)
- the potential range of accessible streams for various fish species, based on swimming ability (ie, identify all stream downstream of natural barriers), referred to in this document as 'potentially accessible habitat'
- streams with the potential to support spawning and rearing stages of various species life cycles (based on stream slope and modelled discharge), referred to in this document as 'potentially usable habitat'
- known anthropogenic barriers (dams, PSCIS assessed barriers, other)
- potential anthropogenic barriers (mapped road/railway stream crossings)

With this information, users can eliminate many potential barriers from further consideration (ie,  sites upstream of natural barriers or hydro dams) and further prioritize watersheds or individual sites for assessment or remediation by ranking by various indicators (for example, length of upstream spawning/rearing habitat and number of potential anthropogenic barriers downstream).

# parameters

Two files are required:

### `parameters_habitat_method`

List of watershed groups to process, and the IP model to use per watershed group, where `cw` indicates channel width and `mad` indicates mean annual discharge

### `parameters_habitat_thresholds`

Per-species thresholds to use for IP modelling:

`species_code`            - species of interest
`spawn_gradient_max`      - maximum stream gradient to model as potential spawning habitat
`spawn_channel_width_min` - minimum channel width to model as potential spawning habitat
`spawn_channel_width_max` - maximum channel width to model as potential spawning habitat (set arbitrarily high to allow no limit)
`spawn_mad_min`           - minimum mean annual discharge to model as potential spawning habitat
`spawn_mad_max`           - maximum mean annual discharge to model as potential spawning habitat
`rear_gradient_max`       - maximum stream gradient to model as potential rearing habitat          
`rear_channel_width_min`  - minimum channel width to model as potential rearing habitat               
`rear_channel_width_max`  - maximum channel width to model as potential rearing habitat (set arbitrarily high to allow no limit)               
`rear_mad_min`            - minimum mean annual discharge to model as potential rearing habitat     
`rear_mad_max`            - maximum mean annual discharge to model as potential rearing habitat     
`rear_lake_ha_min`        - minimum lake area to model as potential rearing habitat (sockeye only)        


See files in the `example` folders for sample parameters.

Note that both files are required - create both files even if only modelling access (not potential linear spawning/rearing habitat).

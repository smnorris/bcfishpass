# Modelling road/railway - stream crossings

Generate potential locations of road/railway stream crossings and associated structures in British Columbia.

In addition to generating the intersection points of roads/railways and streams, attempt to:

- remove duplicate crossings
- identify crossings that are likely to be bridges/open bottom structures
- maintain a consistent unique identifier value (`modelled_crossing_id`) that is stable with script re-runs

**NOTE** 
`bcfishpass` defaults to downloading modelled stream crossings from an archive automatically generated by hillcrestgeo servers (weekly, using these scripts). This ensures that the `modelled_crossing_id` values for new records are consistent for all users (as roads are added to the landscape).


## Run scripts

To download existing modelled crossings plus roads/railways:

    make .make/download_archive
    make .make/download_bcdata
    

To generate a fresh set of crossings using the latest roads data, and load correct ids to the output from the archive:

    make .make/modelled_stream_crossings

To publish the latest:

    make .make/publish


## Fixes

Because the above errors will often result in erroneous modelled culverts with a great deal of stream and potential habitat upstream, it is important to conduct a manual review of the modelled crossings before prioritizing sites for field assessment.  A manual review is generally a simple visual review of available satellite imagery - the user can quickly identify sites where it is clear that a bridge is present or no road/stream crossing is present.

To apply these fixes, add the crossing id and fix information for the crossing of interest to [`data/modelled_stream_crossings_fixes.csv`](data/modelled_stream_crossings_fixes.csv)

#### modelled_stream_crossings_fixes.csv

| Column               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
|`modelled_crossing_id`| ID of modelled crossing |
|`watershed_group_code`| watershed group code of watershed in which crossing lies (for quick reference only) |
|`reviewer`            | initials of user conducting review |
|`structure`           | `OBS` - a bridge is present; `NONE` - no stream crossing (or structure) is present
|`notes`               | relevant notes based on review of imagery and/or other sources

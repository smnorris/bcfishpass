## Freshwater Fish Habitat Accessibility MODEL â€“ Pacific Salmon and Steelhead

A weekly bcfishpass data extract of Pacific Salmon (Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink, Sockeye) and Steelhead access models (and associated data) is [available for download](https://bcfishpass.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/freshwater_fish_habitat_accessibility_MODEL.gpkg.zip).

The models included in this distribution are generated as described in [access model](02_model_access.md), with the following parameters:

- for salmon, [potential gradient barriers](02_model_access.md#generate-gradient-barriers) are considered passable up to 15%
- for steelhead, [potential gradient barriers](02_model_access.md#generate-gradient-barriers) are considered passable up to 20%
- for both salmon and steelhead, potential natural barriers with 5 or more upstream observations of any of the target species (`CH, CM, CO, PK, SK, ST`) since January 01, 1990 are presumed to be passable

### crossings

Aggregated stream crossing locations.  Sources:

- PSCIS stream crossings (matched to FWA streams)
- CABD dams
- modelled road/rail/trail stream crossings
- misc anthropogenic barriers from expert/local input

Includes barrier status, key attributes from source datasets, and upstream length total summaries.

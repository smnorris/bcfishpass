-- Remove crossing duplication caused by using multiple sources for the same road.

-- When removing duplicates, we consider sources in this order
-- of presumed spatial accuracy (FTEN and OGC are tenures, not as-built)
-- 1. DRA
-- 2. FTEN
-- 3. OGC permits
-- 4. OGC pre-06
-- (don't consider railways, there is only one source)

-- Retain the ids of the deleted duplicate records by adding them to the
-- retained/matched records. This is desirable because FTEN attributes are valuable
-- for fish passage work (tenure holder etc)

-- To do this:
-- From records to be filtered for duplicates (eg ften), find all points
-- that are within 20m of higher priority crossings (dra in the case of ften).
-- First update all the matched DRA crossings with the IDs of the matched FTEN crossings.
-- Note that not as many dra crossings may be updated as ften crossings within 20m - there
-- will be instances of >1 ften crossing within 20m of a single dra crossing.
-- In these cases, the FTEN id (within 20m) retained will be random.
-- With the update done, delete all the ften crossings found within 20m of the
-- dra crossings.
-- Repeat for each source of lower priority, matching the points in the source to all
-- higher priority crossings that have already been processed (ie, the ogc crossings
-- are matched to all DRA and FTEN crossings within 20m)

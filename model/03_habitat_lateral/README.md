# Lateral habitat connectivity model

A model of potential off-channel/lateral Pacific salmon and Steelhead spawning/rearing habitat, plus identification of lateral areas potentially disconnected by railways.


## Method

1. Collect and rasterize (10m) features defining areas of potential off-channel/lateral habitat:
    - areas modelled as 'unconfined valleys' via [VCA](valley_confinement.md)
    - waterbodies from [BC Freshwater Atlas](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg)
    - streams ([FWA streams](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg), buffered by stream order / parent stream order / modelled accessibility / modelled spawning-rearing habitat / seasonality)
    - mapped [historical floodplains](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/mapped-floodplains-in-bc-historical)
2. Merge sources into a single categorical 'potential lateral habitat' raster, retaining only regions connected to streams modelled as accessible
3. Remove built-up areas from potential lateral habitat (ESA land use)
4. Rasterize rail lines, breaching the railway raster at passable structures (known or modelled)
5. Find regions of potential lateral habitat isolated by rail lines

## Usage

When using the remote DEM:

    make

If using a locally stored DEM, it is possible to speed up the jobs by running in parallel.
Do this by setting environment variable `DEM10M` and telling make to run concurrent jobs:

    export DEM10M=/path/to/my/dem.tif
    make --debug=basic -j 8 data/habitat_lateral.tif &> habitat_lateral.log

## Output

Lateral habitat model for Pacific salmon and Steelhead:

As raster:

    data/habitat_lateral.tif

raster values:

    1  potential lateral habitat, connected
    2  potential lateral habitat, disconnected by railway

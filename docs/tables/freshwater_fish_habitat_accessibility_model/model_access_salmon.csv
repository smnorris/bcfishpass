column,description
``segmented_stream_id``,Unique bcfishpass streams table identifier
``linear_feature_id``,"From BC FWA,the unique identifier for a stream segment (flow network arc)"
``edge_type``,"A 4 digit numeric code used by the Freshwater Atlas to identify the various types of water network linear features. eg. 1050."
``blue_line_key``,"From BC FWA, uniquely identifies a single flow line such that a main channel and a secondary channel with the same watershed code would have different blue line keys (the Fraser River and all side channels have different blue line keys)"
``downstream_route_measure``,"The distance, in meters, along the blue_line_key from the mouth of the stream/blue_line_key to the feature"
``upstream_route_measure``,"The distance, in meters, along the blue_line_key from the mouth of the stream/blue_line_key to the upstream end of the feature"
``watershed_group_code``,The watershed group code associated with the feature
``gnis_name``,"The BCGNIS (BC Geographical Names Information System) name associated with the GNIS feature id (an English name was used where available, otherwise another language was selected)"
``stream_order``,"The calculated modified Strahler order"
``stream_magnitude``,"The calculated magnitude"
``gradient``,"Slope of the feature (percent)"
``wscode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA fwa_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``localcode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA local_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``feature_code``,"A value based on the Canadian Council of Surveys and Mapping's (CCSM) system for classification of geographic features."
``obsrvtn_ids_upstr``,IDs of known observations of target fish species upstream

``barriers_anthropogenic_dnstr``,IDs of anthropogenic barriers downstream
``barriers_pscis_dnstr``,IDs of assessed PSCIS barriers downstream
``barriers_dams_dnstr``,IDs of CABD dams downstream noted as barriers
``dam_dnstr_ind``,Indicates if a dam is the first barrier downstream of the stream
``dam_hydro_dnstr_ind``,Indicates if a hydro dam is the first barrier downstream of the stream
``remediated_dnstr_ind``,Indicates if a remediation is present downstream of the stream and before any additional barriers
``geom``,The point geometry associated with the feature

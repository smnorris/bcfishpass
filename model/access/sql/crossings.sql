-- CROSSINGS

-- Table holding *all* stream crossings for reporting (not just barriers)

drop table if exists bcfishpass.crossings;

create table bcfishpass.crossings
(
  -- Note how the aggregated crossing id combines the various ids to create a unique integer, after assigning PSCIS crossings their source crossing id
  -- - to avoid conflict with PSCIS ids, modelled crossings have modelled_crossing_id plus 1000000000 (max modelled crossing id is currently 24742842)
  -- - dams go into the 1100000000 bin
  -- - misc go into the 1200000000 bin

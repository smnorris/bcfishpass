# Linear spawning/rearing habitat model

Streams accessible to fish may be suitable for spawning or rearing, or may only be used as movement corridors to reach such habitats. When estimating fragmentation and prioritizing further work, the amount of usable spawning or rearing habitat (habitat quality) is of greater interest than the raw amount of corridor habitat. In addition to modelling barriers to fish passage, `bcfishpass` can model the intrinsic potential (IP) of streams to support spawning or rearing activities for several species (Pacific Salmon, Steelhead, Bull Trout, Westslope Cutthroat Trout).

Linear spawning/rearing habitat modelling is currently based on species specific criteria for:

- stream gradient
- channel width or discharge (depending on modelling requirments and/or data availability)
- connectivity (rearing streams must be connected to spawning streams)
- feature type (spawning or rearing occurs in stream / wetland / lake etc)

Per species threshold values for stream gradient and discharge/channel width are noted (and can be adjusted) in the file [parameters_habitat_thresholds.csv](
https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/blob/main/parameters/example_testing/parameters_habitat_thresholds.csv).

Sources (via literature and analysis) for these values for Pacific salmon and steelhead are documented in Table 1 of [Rebelatto et al (2024)](https://cwf-fcf.org/en/resources/research-papers/BC_report_formatted_final.pdf).

Output model data is augmented with observed spawning locations from [FISS](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/known-bc-fish-observations-and-bc-fish-distributions) via [bcfishobs](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishobs), PSF's [Pacific Salmon Explorer](https://www.salmonexplorer.ca), and CWF [WCRP](https://www.globalconservationsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CWF-WCRP-Guide.pdf) stakeholder inputs.

## Gradient

Per species spawning/rearing gradient thresholds were taken from the literature and, where unavailable in the literature, derived from known fish spawning locations.

Gradient of each stream segment is calculated as rise over run. Rise is taken from the Z value of the endpoints of the stream segments. Run is the length of the steam segments.  

Stream segments are BC Freshwater Atlas stream network features, further subdivided by other stream-referenced features used in the model (streams are split at barriers and observations when processing the access model).  

Note that stream lengths and resulting gradient will change if a new observation or barrier is added to the database, breaking an existing segment into smaller segments. This results in small inconsistencies to modelled spawning/rearing outputs for a given area over time, a known limitation of the current model.



## Channel width / discharge

Spawning and rearing activity depends on sufficent flow to the stream. `bcfishpass` can be configured to use either mean annual discharge (m3/s) or channel width (m) (as a discharge proxy), depending on data availability and/or user preference. 
Per species spawning and rearing discharge/channel width thresholds are taken from the literature and, where unavailable in the literature, derived from known fish spawning locations. 

Discharge is modelled within the Fraser, Columbia and Peace basins:  

- [PCIC source](https://www.pacificclimate.org/data/gridded-hydrologic-model-output)
- [upsampling of source to FWA streams](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg/tree/main/extras/discharge)

Channel width is modelled for all of BC:  

- [Poisson Consulting](https://www.poissonconsulting.ca/temporary-hidden-link/859859031/channel-width-21b/) model based on upstream area / precipitation
- [data collection/preparation](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg/tree/main/extras/channel_width)

**NOTE** contributing area and precipitiation datasets used to date are both cut off at the BC border

- *all results from the above models are only valid for streams with 100% of their contributing area with BC*
- *streams with contributing area outside of BC (and thus with invalid spawning/rearing models) ARE NOT CURRENTLY NOTED in model outputs/file distributions*



## Feature type and connectivity

For various species and life stages, further filtering of streams to model as potential spawning/rearing habitat (based on gradient and discharge/channel width) is applied via feature type and connectivity criteria:

| Species | Life stage | Additional feature type and connectivity criteria |
|---------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Bull Trout | spawning   | within streams/rivers
| Bull Trout | rearing    | within streams/rivers AND ( <br> on spawning stream OR <br> downstream of spawning stream OR <br> on a tributary downstream of spawning and beginning within 10m of the tributary OR <br> <10km upstream of spawning with no stream segment of slope >=5% between the spawning and potential rearing <br>)   |
| Chinook | spawning   | within streams/rivers          |
| Chinook | rearing    | (within streams/rivers OR wetland) AND (<br> on spawning stream OR downstream of spawning stream OR <br> on a tributary downstream of spawning and beginning within 10m of the tributary OR <br> <10km upstream of spawning with no stream segment of slope exceeding 5% between the spawning and potential rearing <br> )<br>  **Note** - *Chinook rearing in wetlands is not initially restricted by gradient and discharge/channel width*|
| Chum | spawning   | within streams/rivers
| Chum | rearing    | No rearing modelled (this species does not generally rear in fresh water)   |

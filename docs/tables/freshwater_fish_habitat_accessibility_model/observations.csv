column,description
``observation_key``,bcfishobs stable unique id, a hash of columns [source, species_code, observation_date, utm_zone, utm_easting, utm_northing, life_stage_code, activity_code]
``species_code``,"Code corresponding to the species observed, see https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fishbc/blob/master/data-raw/whse_fish_species_cd/whse_fish_species_cd.csv for species descriptions"
``observation_date``,The date on which the observation occurred
``activity_code``,"The fish activity code from the source dataset, such as I for Incubating, or SPE for Spawning In Estuary"
``activity``,"A full textual description of the activity the fish was engaged in when it was observed, such as SPAWNING"
``life_stage_code``, "Life stage of the fish species for this oberservation. Each source dataset of observations uses its own set of LIFE STAGE CODES. For example, in the FDIS dataset, U means Undetermined, NS means Not Specified, M means Mature, IM means Immature, and MT means Maturing. Descriptions for each ``life_stage_code`` are given in the ``life_stage`` attribute"
``life_stage``,"Description corresponding to the ``life_stage_code``"
``acat_report_url``,"URL to the ACAT REPORT which provides additional information about the observation"
``linear_feature_id``,"From BC FWA,the unique identifier for a stream segment (flow network arc)"
``blue_line_key``,"From BC FWA, uniquely identifies a single flow line such that a main channel and a secondary channel with the same watershed code would have different blue line keys (the Fraser River and all side channels have different blue line keys)"
``downstream_route_measure``,"The distance, in meters, along the blue_line_key from the mouth of the stream/blue_line_key to the feature"
``wscode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA fwa_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``localcode``,A truncated version of the BC FWA local_watershed_code (trailing zeros removed and '-' replaced with '.'
``watershed_group_code``,The watershed group code associated with the feature
``geom``,The point geometry associated with the feature

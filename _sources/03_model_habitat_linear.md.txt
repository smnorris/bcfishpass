# Linear habitat model

Streams accessible to fish may be suitable for spawning or rearing, or may only be used as movement corridors to reach such habitats. When estimating fragmentation, the amount of usable spawning or rearing habitat is of greater interest than the amount of corridor habitat. In addition to modelling barriers to fish passage, `bcfishpass` models the intrinsic potential (IP) of streams to support spawning or rearing activities for several species (Pacific Salmon, Steelhead, Bull Trout, Westslope Cutthroat Trout).

Linear habitat IP modelling is currently based on:

- channel width or discharge (depending on modelling requirments and/or data availability)
- stream gradient
- connectivity (rearing streams must be connected to spawning streams)
- other species specific criteria

bcfishpass
=================================

``bcfishpass`` is a collection of scripts to create and maintain an aquatic connectivity / fish passage database for British Columbia.

The ``bcfishpass`` database:

- tracks/models natural barriers to fish passage (waterfalls, steep gradients, other)
- tracks/models anthropogenic barriers to fish passage (dams, road/rail stream crossings (culverts), other)
- models accessibility of streams to given fish species based on natural and anthropogenic barriers
- models potential spawning and rearing habitat for select species based on stream gradient and either modelled discharge or modelled channel width
- enables prioritization of stream crossing sites for field assessment
- provides tools for visualizing and quantifying aquatic connectivity / fish passage issues in BC
